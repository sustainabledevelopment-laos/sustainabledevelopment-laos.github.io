We are continuing to source additional disaggregations.\n  Statistics in progress (amber) – we have found a suitable source of data for this indicator or relevant proxy at national level. We are currently quality assuring the data and preparing it for publication.\n  Exploring data sources (red) – we are still looking for a suitable data source for this indicator.\n\n\nWhere there is additional information about the status of indicator data collection and reporting, this will be displayed at the top of the indicator page.\n\nHow often will new data be added to this site?\nWe will add data as soon as it has been sourced and checked. This includes new data as well as updates to data we have already published. We will continue to collect data from existing sources where possible, in cooperation with topic experts.\n\nWhat are you doing to fill data gaps?\nFor some indicators, although we may have data at the national level, our existing data sources don’t always allow us to disaggregate by all main groups.\n\nThis means we need to look for new data sources, link existing ones, or model data.\n\nHow accessible is this website?\nOur aim is to make this website as accessible and usable as possible for every user. We are working towards meeting AA level of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.0).\n\nWhat browsers can I use to view this website?\nOur website works with most of the latest versions of the commonly used browsers. There are some issues with using the site on older versions of browsers eg IE8 and we are working to fix these.\n\nCan other countries copy this website?\nYes. This site is built and hosted using 100% free software and services, so other countries and localities can freely and easily reuse our code. Technical guidance on implementing this platform is available here. Countries and localities exploring how to report their own SDGs data can also get support from the Center for Open Data Enterprise (CODE) through their SDG National Reporting Initiative.\n","id":""},"/en/en/guidance/":{"type":"Pages","url":"/en/en/guidance/","title":"Guidance\n","content":"This page shares information for people using this website and for countries or localities wishing to take a copy of it.\n\nThe platform\n\nThis site is built and hosted using an open-source platform with 100% free software and services.
